# Allstar Nexus Project Initialization

This document outlines the plan for initializing the Allstar Nexus project.

## Phased Plan

### Phase 1: Project Setup (Current Phase)

1.  **Create `copilot-instructions.md`**: This file will serve as our guide for the project, outlining the plan and instructions for me to follow.
2.  **Initialize Git and GitHub Repository**: I will initialize a local Git repository and then create a new public repository on GitHub for you.
3.  **Scaffold the Project**: I will set up a new Next.js application, which is a great choice for a modern web project.

### Phase 2: Core Feature Development

This phase will focus on building the main features of your application, such as user authentication and the main dashboard.

### Phase 3: Backend and Deployment

In this phase, I will help you develop the backend logic and set up a deployment pipeline.
